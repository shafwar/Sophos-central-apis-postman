# Sophos Central APIs - Postman Collection

## 🛡️ Overview

This project is a web-based platform designed to enhance **cybersecurity** for companies by integrating and testing **Sophos Central APIs**. The platform aims to ensure secure data flow between systems using **Postman collections** for thorough API request validation and security assurance.

## 🔐 Purpose

The main objective of this project is to simulate and test various security operations through API endpoints provided by Sophos. By leveraging **Postman**, we automate the verification of:
- Authentication mechanisms
- Access controls
- Data integrity and confidentiality
- Threat detection responses

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Pre-configured Postman collection for Sophos Central APIs
- ✅ Environment variables for secure token management
- ✅ Real-time request/response inspection
- ✅ Security test cases to ensure endpoint robustness
- ✅ Easy integration with CI/CD for automated API security validation

## 🧪 Tools Used

- **Postman**: For API testing and automation
- **VS Code + GitHub Codespaces**: For seamless cloud-based development
- **Sophos Central API**: For endpoint protection and monitoring
- **Node.js / Python**: Optional scripts to support extended testing

## 🏢 Use Case

This repository is ideal for IT security teams, developers, and analysts looking to:
- Evaluate how secure their company’s API infrastructure is
- Simulate real-world attacks on API endpoints
- Ensure data privacy compliance by inspecting token and session handling
